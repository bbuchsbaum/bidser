\title{Search Files in Mock BIDS Structure}
\usage{
\method{search_files}{mock_bids_project}(x, regex = ".*", full_path = FALSE, strict = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{mock_bids_project} object.}

\item{regex}{A regular expression to match filenames (node names). Default \code{".*"}.}

\item{full_path}{If \code{TRUE}, return full paths (prefixed with \code{x$path}).
If \code{FALSE}, return relative paths within the BIDS structure. Default \code{FALSE}.}

\item{strict}{If \code{TRUE} (default), queries for a BIDS entity (e.g., \code{task="X"})
require the entity to exist on the file node and match the pattern.
If \code{FALSE}, files lacking the queried entity are not automatically excluded
(though they won't match if the pattern isn't \verb{.*}).}

\item{...}{Additional BIDS entities to match (e.g., \code{subid = "01"}, \code{task = "rest"}).
Values are treated as regex patterns unless they are simple strings without regex characters.}
}
\value{
A character vector of matching file paths, or \code{NULL} if no matches.
}
\description{
Finds files in the mock BIDS tree by matching file names and BIDS entities.
