Title: Work with BIDS projects
Description: Tools for working with Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) formatted neuroimaging datasets.
    The package provides functionality for reading, validating, and querying BIDS-compliant 
    projects, creating mock BIDS datasets for testing, and extracting preprocessed data from 
    BIDS derivatives. It supports searching and filtering BIDS files by various entities
    such as subject, session, task, and run to streamline neuroimaging data workflow.
