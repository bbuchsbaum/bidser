Title: Work with Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) Projects
Description: Tools for working with Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) formatted neuroimaging datasets.
    The package provides functionality for reading, validating, and querying BIDS-compliant
    projects, creating mock BIDS datasets for testing, and extracting preprocessed data from
    BIDS derivatives. It supports searching and filtering BIDS files by various entities
    such as subject, session, task, and run to streamline neuroimaging data workflow.
    See Gorgolewski et al. (2016) <doi:10.1038/sdata.2016.44> for the BIDS specification.
